dozes off, clothes on, nose in the feedbag
will see you at the bottom, ZZZ top
crowbars into the pecking order
got the motordrome walls of death splintering under him
wrote this on a self-destructing memo...
wishes it mattered to you
spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
is snake-eye straight to the cakes icing
is honey glaze in vitro
boils oil too, not for scarfing
wants a fucking "amen"
was rotating casts
will even grit his teeth for you
and Kimya Dawson are not gonna rot, no, fuck that snot
and Kimya Dawson are not going to watch
and Kimya Dawson are not gonna stand atop your plot
and Kimya Dawson love you friends, but they're just not
is so completely off the god-damn grid it's not a question of addressing him, it's "what do these symbols under the dresser mean?"
seems stand off-ish
can't call it
says you wanna feel saved baby shape the orb
will see you all in Helven
and Kimya Dawson can do mohawks fauxhauks, afros, halfros, racing stripes, fringes, high top fades, mullets, reverse mullets, crew cuts and much, much more!
just needed a little off the top
just wants to take a look
knew this kid Camu
said, "You look insane"
encourages you to share and apply and adapt
wears shoes to bed
paints teeth on his lips
has got a couple unsubstantiated thoughts of his own
will see to this loose flatbread
will have what he's having
hereby wins
hopes you vow to meow another day and never decompose
feels that mystifying times have gotten ugly
also feels that you could learn a lot from a mummy
can't do it
could sit here all night
told em "Oh he busy, he staring at his green beans being a total pussy"
speaks and spells of a sleeper cell in the hospice
told em "Oh he can't, he in the kitchen pouting and terrified of a plant"
is looking down the barrel of a string-bean side like an exodus of biblical proportion redefined
keep the foot, peep
is not a page or a pull toy
came in the door and the floor is lava
hates you
hates you more
hates you infinity
is all pincer, fevery hoodie-on hoodie-off
is a symbol of whimsy abridged
is a patchwork of 86'd springs and gears
turns a staff to a snake and back
never lost tic tac toe to a live chicken
knows this is why we can't have nice things
prefers to skip the pleasantries
wouldn't piss on your coffin
sees your picture draws dicks on it
is cam dynamite fishin'
has never heard of knocking
accidentally sawed a woman in half
said "I need to hide a body"
pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt
told them, "You will grow to be something inventive and electric; You are healthy, you are special, you are present"
let them go
was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark
told them, "You will grow to be something tenacious and exalted; You are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded"
has been completely unable to maintain any semblance of relationship on any level
has been a bastard to the people who have actively attempted to deliver him from peril
has been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up and lip that kissed him on the temple
has been accustomed to a stubborn disposition that admits it wishes history disassembled
has been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance while skimming for a ministry to pretzel
has been unfairly resentful of those he wishes that acted different when the bidding was essential
has been a terrible communicator prone to isolation over sympathy for devils
has been his own worst enemy since the very genesis of rebels
pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand where the low tide showcased a promised land
told them, "You will grow to be something dynamic and impressive; You are patient, you are gallant, you are festive"
spells 666-star-six-nine click
would openly suggest identifying the closest
would like to speak to a supervisor
and Rob Sonic are driving through the city in the Porsche, naked
can't wait to hear it
dead messengers buried in their Melvin shirts
is a weekend burglar
is on his lunch break. You want to help him kill half an hour?
is like "hell no. Your buzz is as organic as Monsanto."
is going at your beanstalk, ax in hand
is only winning cause he went in an gettin' waked
