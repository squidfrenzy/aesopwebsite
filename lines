dozes off, clothes on, nose in the feedbag
will see you at the bottom, ZZZ top
crowbars into the pecking order
got the motordrome walls of death splintering under him
wrote this on a self-destructing memo...
wishes it mattered to you
spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
is snake-eye straight to the cakes icing
is honey glaze in vitro
boils oil too, not for scarfing
wants a fucking "amen"
was rotating casts
will even grit his teeth for you
and Kimya Dawson are not gonna rot
and Kimya Dawson are not going to watch
and Kimya Dawson are not gonna stand atop your plot
and Kimya Dawson love you friends, but they're just not
is so completely off the god-damn grid it's not a question of addressing him, it's "what do these symbols under the dresser mean?"
seems stand off-ish
can't call it
says you wanna feel saved baby shape the orb
will see you all in Helven
and Kimya Dawson can do mohawks fauxhauks, afros, halfros, racing stripes, fringes, high top fades, mullets, reverse mullets, crew cuts and much, much more!
just needed a little off the top
just wants to take a look
knew this kid Camu
said, "You look insane"
encourages you to share and apply and adapt
wears shoes to bed
paints teeth on his lips
has got a couple unsubstantiated thoughts of his own
will see to this loose flatbread
will have what he's having
hereby wins
hopes you vow to meow another day and never decompose
feels that mystifying times have gotten ugly
also feels that you could learn a lot from a mummy
can't do it
could sit here all night
told em "Oh he busy, he staring at his green beans being a total pussy"
speaks and spells of a sleeper cell in the hospice
told em "Oh he can't, he in the kitchen pouting and terrified of a plant"
is looking down the barrel of a string-bean side like an exodus of biblical proportion redefined
kept the foot, peep
is not a page or a pull toy
came in the door and the floor is lava
hates you
hates you more
hates you infinity
is all pincer, fevery hoodie-on hoodie-off
is a symbol of whimsy abridged
is a patchwork of 86'd springs and gears
turns a staff to a snake and back
never lost tic tac toe to a live chicken
knows this is why we can't have nice things
prefers to skip the pleasantries
wouldn't piss on your coffin
sees your picture draws dicks on it
is cam dynamite fishin'
has never heard of knocking
accidentally sawed a woman in half
said "I need to hide a body"
pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt
told them, "You will grow to be something inventive and electric; You are healthy, you are special, you are present"
let them go
was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark
told them, "You will grow to be something tenacious and exalted; You are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded"
has been completely unable to maintain any semblance of relationship on any level
has been a bastard to the people who have actively attempted to deliver him from peril
has been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up and lip that kissed him on the temple
has been accustomed to a stubborn disposition that admits it wishes history disassembled
has been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance while skimming for a ministry to pretzel
has been unfairly resentful of those he wishes that acted different when the bidding was essential
has been a terrible communicator prone to isolation over sympathy for devils
has been his own worst enemy since the very genesis of rebels
pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand where the low tide showcased a promised land
told them, "You will grow to be something dynamic and impressive; You are patient, you are gallant, you are festive"
spells 666-star-six-nine click
would openly suggest identifying the closest and collectively agreeing to meet if the sky opens

is going at your beanstalk, ax in hand
is only winning cause he went in an gettin' waked
gave one to Rex
flies these kites into the fray
flies these kites into the cut
said hello to Marshall every morn for 6
stepped over a body in the door
pretends he asleep but it's probably more, God damn
is at the cafe ordering a cup of fresh
is off the grid
is through the gate
is out the box
is through the mud
is ships in the night
is darts at a map
used to draw
left some years a deer in the light
left some will to spirit away
let his fears materialize
let his skills deteriorate
is haunted by the thought of what he should have been continuing
used to paint
left some seasons eager to fall
left some work to bury alive
let his means of being dissolve
let his person curl up and die
watched him relocating pistachio to a waffle
ordered something daft
spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists so when they drew him tattoos he could truly feel important
should give a shit less
watched her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes
feels so fucking old
bets you clone your pets and ride a hover-board to work
used a folding map to find the juice place in the first
could ollie up a curb
was bumping New Edition, dragging acne into Hades
is still recovering from church
used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain
thinks it's funny when defendants from identical haunts step out the tempest
used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene
knows some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe
thinks we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong
ain't even mad, he's impressed, shit it's baffling
view the rattling of sabers like a show to expose

will be over there
might've heard something in the walls
is here to pick lice off each other and assimilate
is pretty useless
would rather feed an apple to a deer
should pray occult
will estrange you all
get ghost
gotta think about it
doesn't know which makes him a bigger coward
doesn't pick teams or administer bans
is a ghost
is in the creek with a pick and a pan, it go
was 10, chewing on a Sweet Tart
caught him staring down at something moving through the grass
wants to put one up for his brothers
called him last night: "How you doing?"
recalls thinking, "Someday someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect"
just couldn't fathom blaming a whole new page on a made-up chain reaction
can finally admit it's all been a blur since Mu got sick
was poison, heart full of canines, head full of voices
was basically done
can't
could pinpoint 7 more turns that occurred 'cause he never really healed from the first
is burning up
is bleeding out
finally crunched the budget up and punched the button
said, "That sounds like something that my enemy would say."
said, "I'm being guarded. You're a quarter-mil' in debt; I get more guidance from my barber."
said, "Look-I'm not good at this, I grew up in a noogie-fest. You built your walls up high or said goodbye to all your Cooky-Puss."
sees images of hooded riders setting fire to hundreds every time his telephone buzzes
said, "When you start getting all exact and algebraic I'm reminded it's a racket, not a rehabilitation."

is burger meat and purple pills
is shrunk
is half a human, combin' over Home and Garden stoned

thinks she's broken
swapped 20 on the spot and cop the warlock
looks like he's wearing a ghillie suit when he's not
reads Nat Geo
paints caves 'til the rage campaign tapers
still hangs band posters and buys black-lights
pays a guy to lean over steepled fingers
learns to rhyme in New York
learned to breathe underwater
learned to walk with a ghost
can't tell if he's a little withdrawn or dead dog sent to quote/unquote "live on a farm"
still pretends he's gonna build another half-pipe
was skate or die
wished he was a theist
sometimes feels his heart putrefying inside his body
pretends he likes agave
should kinda sorta move to Mars
can't remember where he is
feels it's probably a trap
is at the Supercuts soupin' up the wardrobe
feeling kinda done, too many moving parts
said, "I'll take first watch"
could drive into a lake of fire
called Alex back
never really was a leader
is paper china dinner, mostly picking at his stitches
picks a ginger gold as fed by a drunken uncle
told his ex in '97 he was falling on his weapon
had a pet lizard, he never got an obit
is born from the guts of stars and black tar pits
paints "No Rules" on the water tower
pushes a bucket of bolts, assorted death in his wake
takes the hand off the thief
takes the head off a snake
knows you love the way the failure flounder
could be your daily downer
is catatonic, fat, and outta rocket-fuel and ramen
